Hacking on genslide
*******************

Build tools requirements
========================

The only requirement for hacking on genslide is python >= 2.6 and autotools.

Working with the source code repository
=======================================

The normal steps to checkout, build and install is like this:

  Checkout repository:
    $ git clone git@github.com:lucasdemarchi/genslide.git
    $ cd genslide

  Configure and build:
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make

  Install:
    $ make install

  Remove autogenerated files:
    $ make maintainer-clean


Running from whithin the source code repository
===============================================

There's no special configuration for running from within the source code
repository. The only note is that you must re-generate autogenereated files
every time a '.in' file is modified. This accomplished by:

    $ ./autogen.sh

To run genslide, on the root of the repository:

    $ ./genslide-bin

Be aware that you'll have to fiddle with command lines flags in order to find
the right directory for themes and data.

About and dependencies
======================

genslide generates a latex file out from a simple text file (or an url address
from certain sites containing lyrics). This file is to be given as input to
pdflatex in order to have the slides generated with that lyric.

To be completed used you'll need these external software packages:
	- Latex
	- Beamer module for latex
	- pdflatex

However, you can still generate the .tex file without having these softwares,
but you'll not be able to generate the final file.


Grammar
=======

A lyric is written as a simple text file having the title on the first line and
each verse separated by a blank line. See the example (ignore the first tab):

	Title here

	First verse starts here
	and it has
	three lines

	Second verse starts here
	and it has only 2 lines

genslide will read this simple file and generate the correspondent .tex file.
See the file GRAMMAR for more advanced usages.

Compilation and instalation
===========================

genslide is a python program, you don't really have to compile it. But you
still have to configure so all the paths are configured and the bytecode are
generated.

To configure run:
	./configure --prefix=/usr

Configure will set up all the paths to be installed under /usr. The default
prefix is /usr/local/.

To install run:
	make && make install

Running without installing
==========================

It's possible to run genslide without installing it. All you have to do is to
call the main program, genslide-bin, on the root directory:
	./genslide-bin

However in this case, paths for genslide themes and data will not be set up and
you'll have to pass them as command line options.

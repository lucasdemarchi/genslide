Simple lyric
============

	Title

	First verse
	with two lines

	Second verse with
	three lines
	here.


Blank lines in a verse
======================

To force a blank line to be inserted in a verse without starting a new verse,
use "\" to escape it, like this:

	Title

	This is a lyric
	with a single verse
	but this verse contains a blank line
	\
	Above was blank


Chorus
======

A lyric might contain a chorus. If a verse is a chorus, it will be repeated
after each other verse. A verse is marked as chorus by a '\c' in any place of
current verse. Example:

	title

	This is the first verse
	that contains 2 lines

	\c
	This verse is marked as chorus
	So it will be repeated after each
	other verse

	For example, this is the third verse
	and after this, the chorus will appear again
	in the final .tex file


You can have a lyric with more than one chorus. What happens is that the second
chorus replaces the first one after that point. Example:

	Title

	First verse

	\c
	first chorus

	another verse

	another verse

	\c
	second chorus

	another verse

The final result will be:

	Title

	First verse

	first chorus

	another verse

	first chorus

	another verse

	second chorus

	another verse

	second chorus

Repeat block
============

In a verse, a certain block can be marked to be repeated. This is useful when
there's, for example, a lyric that repeats n times the same phrase. In slides
showing lyrics we usually see this like below:


	these three lines
	will be repeated              3x
	again again and again

With genslide this is achieved by marking the block to be repeated with the "|"
at the beginning of each line, followed by the text to be used as repetition
mark. This mark will be placed at the middle of that block.

	|these three lines
	|will be repeated
	|again again and again
	3x

Be warned that as of now there's no control if the block spans for more than
one slide. Bad things will happen if you mark, let's say, 10 lines to be
repeated. This feature is intended for few lines.
